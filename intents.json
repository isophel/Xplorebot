        "Tourism, the act and process of spending time away from home in pursuit of recreation, relaxation, and pleasure, while making use of the commercial provision of services \n Tourism has grown tremendously over the last decade with the improvement in security in the northern part of the country, and huge infrastructure investments from private and government. However, many challenges remain, including the need for government leadership to develop the sector, skills upgrading in the industry, investment in the parks and other protected areas, and a much stronger marketing effort for Ugandan tourism. Still, the sector has greatly impacted the growth of household welfare by creating more jobs \n Read more at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_Uganda"

        "Gorillas display uncanny human characteristics. The close-knit family groups are headed by a silverback - a mature male - who selects places for the group to eat and sleep, and has many privileges, including the right to feed first. This privilege pays off for the rest of the family as if the group is threatened, the silverback - weighing up to 120kg (260lbs) - will defend them to death, if necessary.\r\n\r\nGenerally, though, the gorilla is a gentle species. They are considered to be highly intelligent, have been observed using tools like other great apes, and communicate using a variety of vocal sounds.\r\n\r\nThe name gorilla comes from the Greek gorillai - meaning hairy women."
