Visitor: how does a gorilla mate Posted on: 2021-12-07 19:14:22.278496
Xplorebot:Gorillas display uncanny human characteristics. The close-knit family groups are headed by a silverback - a mature male - who selects places for the group to eat and sleep, and has many privileges, including the right to feed first. This privilege pays off for the rest of the family as if the group is threatened, the silverback - weighing up to 120kg (260lbs) - will defend them to death, if necessary.

Generally, though, the gorilla is a gentle species. They are considered to be highly intelligent, have been observed using tools like other great apes, and communicate using a variety of vocal sounds.

The name gorilla comes from the Greek gorillai - meaning hairy women. Responded on: 2021-12-07 19:14:22.280496

Xplorebot:Tourism, the act and process of spending time away from home in pursuit of recreation, relaxation, and pleasure, while making use of the commercial provision of services 
 Tourism has grown tremendously over the last decade with the improvement in security in the northern part of the country, and huge infrastructure investments from private and government. However, many challenges remain, including the need for government leadership to develop the sector, skills upgrading in the industry, investment in the parks and other protected areas, and a much stronger marketing effort for Ugandan tourism. Still, the sector has greatly impacted the growth of household welfare by creating more jobs

Visitor: tell me about lions Posted on: 2021-12-08 08:18:38.540886
Xplorebot:African lions (Panthera leo) are the largest and most imposing carnivore in Africa. They are the only true social cats and have special cultural significance in most countries on the continent. In Uganda, lions enjoy a reputation as ‘king of the beasts’ and are popular symbols of royalty, strength and bravery.  Lions live in a ‘fission-fusion’ society which is a fairly rare social system similar to chimpanzees. Individuals have different home ranges that overlap so that they regularly meet and come together. Males are thrown out of the group at the age of 3-4 years by the dominant male(s) and will try to take over a pride when they get to 7-10 years old. Males usually hole a pride for 2-3 years only before being ousted by another male or coalition of males.  Females generally stay in the same area as their mothers, occasionally moving to an adjacent pride when subadult, and rear a litter of cubs every two years. The highest mortality of lions is in the cubs with often whole litters being killed by other predators or buffalos.
 In Uganda lions are mainly found in the three largest savannah parks: Murchison Falls National Park (MFNP), Kidepo Valley National Park (KVNP) and Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP). In QENP, the Ishasha lions are known for their unique behavior of climbing trees and have been branded the Ishasha tree-climbing lions by tourists.  Lions, after mountain gorillas, are the most sought-after species by tourists visiting Uganda
